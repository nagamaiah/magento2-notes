					RabbitMQ (Message Queue System)

-- RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
-- RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software also known as a message broker or queue manager.					
-- By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer, in sequence. On average every consumer will get 
   the same number of messages. This way of distributing messages is called round-robin.


-- A message can include any kind of information. It could, for example, have information about a process or task that should 
   start on another application (which could even be on another server), or it could be just a simple text message.
-- The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and takes a message off the queue. 
   The receiving application then processes the message.   
-- It can be used to reduce loads and delivery times of web application servers by delegating tasks that would normally take up 
   a lot of time or resources to a third party that has no other job.
