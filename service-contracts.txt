				Magento 2 Service Contracts

-- A service contract is a set of PHP interfaces that is defined by a module. This contract comprises data interfaces and service interfaces.

-- The role of the data interface is to preserve data integrity, while the role of the service interface is to hide the business 
   logic details from service consumers.

-- Data interfaces define various functions, such as validation, entity information, search related functions, and so on. They are defined 
   within the Api/Data directory of an individual module.
   
-- Service interfaces are the ones that include management, repository, and metadata interfaces. These interfaces are defined directly 
   within the module's Api directory.
