# MSRP : Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (List Price)

   to highlight discounts or show customers the potential savings.

   price of a product is the price at which its manufacturer notionally recommends that a retailer sell the product.

# MAP : Minimum Advertised Price

   the brand's value and profits by ensuring that the products cannot be priced below a pre-decided amount.
