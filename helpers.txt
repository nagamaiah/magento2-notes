				Magento Helper Classes

# What is _construct() method ?
-- The _construct method was a "Varien invention" used to wrap some initialization logic in models, helpers and blocks.
-- The _construct() method is implemented by Magento in some classes and it's called automatically inside the __construct function declaration
	abstract class AbstractResource
	{
	    /**
	     * Main constructor
	     */
	    public function __construct()
	    {
		/**
		 * Please override this one instead of overriding real __construct constructor
		 */
		$this->_construct();
	    }
	}
-- In a Resource Model or Model Class you should define a _construct() method in order to define the table and the primary_key
-- It's unusual to change or re-declare the native __construct() method in magento Models/Blocks or Helpers since we always use the Magento factories.
-- Single underscore construct (_construct) is used to avoid overriding the actual constructor with double underscore (__construct).
-- Please override this one instead of overriding real __construct constructor
