1. Simple Product 
-- Magento Core Class : \Magento\Catalog\Model\Product\Type\Simple 
-- A standalone single product with no variations and no customizations
-- A simple product can be sold individually or as part of a grouped, configurable, or bundle product. 
-- A simple product with custom options is sometimes referred to as a composite product. 
-- Examples
	T-shirt in a single color and size.
	

2. Configurable Product
-- Magento Core Class : \Magento\ConfigurableProduct\Model\Product\Type\Configurable
-- Allow customers to choose different product options and variations like color, size etc., 
   each with its own SKU to track inventory for each product variation
-- The configurable product type is a good choice for products with multiple options. 
-- The input type of any attribute that is used for a product variation must be one of the following: 
   Dropdown, Visual Swatch (showing colors), or Text Swatch(XS, S, L, M).  
-- The Stock Status of the configurable product is a semi-manually controlled setting. 
   It is partially controlled by the stock status of its child products
-- Examples
	Clothing items with options for size and color.
	

3. Grouped Product
-- Magento Core Class : \Magento\GroupedProduct\Model\Product\Type\Grouped
-- Collection of simple products that are sold together as a single item
-- A grouped product consists of simple standalone products that are presented as a group

   In the shopping cart, each item and the quantity purchased is displayed as a separate line item.
  
4. Virtual Product

-- A Non-tangible item that doesn't require shipping such as Subscription, services

6. Downloadable Product
-- Magento Core Class : \Magento\Downloadable\Model\Product\Type
-- A downloadable product can be anything that you can deliver as a file, such as an eBook, music, video, software application, or update.
-- Because the download is not available until after the purchase, you can provide samples, such as an excerpt from a book
-- You can determine the number of times a customer can download a product.
-- Because downloadable products are not shipped, the Shipping step of the checkout is skipped when the cart contains only the downloadable product.
-- By default, Stock Status is set to Out of Stock.
-- Because downloadable products are not shipped, the Weight field is not used. (This item has no weight)
-- Selling digital(electronic version) goods that customers can access after purchase.

	   A shipping address is not necessary.
	2. Physical - A physical gift card is shipped to recipient’s address, which is required during the purchase of the gift card.
	3. Combined - A combined gift card is shipped and emailed to the recipient. The recipient’s email and shipping address is required 
	   during the purchase of the gift card.

-- Taxes are not applied to gift cards during the gift card purchase. Taxes are applied to products only when a purchased gift card is used to buy products.
