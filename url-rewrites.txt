1. The URL Rewrite tool lets you change any URL that is associated with a product, category, or CMS page. 
   A URL rewrite changes the way a URL appears in the browser. A URL redirect updates the URL that is stored on the server.
2. The Request Path contains the URL key or path of the original redirect from page. The Target Path contains the URL of the redirect to page.
3. We need to find target path using product or category or cms (id).
4. Then we need to specify request path and target path and save the rewrite.
